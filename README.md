# Gorilla-Data-Extraction
Unix commands for extracting variables from Gorilla experiment builder files. 
While similar approaches can be done in statistical packages, I find UNIX to be more accessible and efficient. 

I am not affiliated with Gorilla in any capacity.

Gorilla experiment builder is a customizable, browser-based data collection tool for self-report data and cognitive testing in experimental psychology. It is affordable and user-friendly. See their website for more details https://gorilla.sc/
